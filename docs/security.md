# Weglet's security model

Three files pointed at this document before it existed:
`rust/weglet-security/src/risk.rs`, `ui/src/newtab.ts` and
`ui/src/toolbar.ts`. Each of them defers an argument to it, so the
argument is here.

## What Weglet promises

**No request the user did not ask for.** Opening the browser, opening a
tab, opening a settings page: none of these talk to the network. There is
no telemetry, no update ping, no font fetch, no metrics upload.

This is a constraint on the code, not a preference, and it is what several
otherwise-odd decisions are for:

- **Fonts are files in the binary**, not a CDN request. `ui/fonts/` is
  embedded by `ui/build_ui.py` and referenced by `@font-face` rules
  generated into `tokens.css`.
- **Icons are path data in `ui/src/icons.ts`**, not fetched SVGs.
- **The new tab page draws a letter, not a favicon, by default.** Asking a
  third party for a site's icon tells that party what the user has
  pinned or has open, before they have typed or clicked anything else.
  The tab strip and the bookmarks list do the same. Settings' Appearance
  tab has a "Show site icons" toggle, off by default, that turns this on
  -- accepting only after a warning, since re-enabling it is exactly the
  trade-off the paragraph above describes. `weglet_favicons_enabled` /
  `weglet_set_favicons_enabled` carry the setting; `img-src` in
  `weglet_web_ui_data_source.cc` is the only CSP directive that allows an
  off-machine request at all, and only for images.
- **`WegletBrowserContext` returns `nullptr`** for the push messaging
  service, the platform notification service and the background sync
  controller. Each of those is a subsystem that can open a connection on
  its own.
- **`chrome://weglet/` has `default-src 'none'`.** A page of ours has no
  CSP source that reaches off the machine at all beyond the favicon
  exception above, so a future mistake elsewhere fails loudly instead of
  quietly phoning home.

## The privilege boundary

Weglet's own pages are ordinary web pages that happen to have a channel to
the browser process. What separates them from the web is content's WebUI
bindings, and those are granted per frame, by
`WegletWebUIControllerFactory::UseWebUIForURL`.

That function is the boundary. It tests an exact scheme and an exact host:

```cpp
url.SchemeIs(content::kChromeUIScheme) && url.host() == kHost
```

Not a prefix test. A prefix test would accept
`chrome://weglet.evil.example/` and hand it `chrome.send()`.

Everything downstream follows from that answer. There is no allow-list in
the message handler deciding which pages may send which messages, because
a page that is not ours never receives a handler at all.

**Arguments are still checked, every message, every time.** The pages are
our own code, but they run in a renderer process, and a compromised
renderer is precisely what this boundary exists for. The check is
generated from `ui/contract.json`: `WegletMessageHandler::Validate`
compares what arrived against the arity and argument types the contract
declares.

## What the risk heuristics are, and are not

`rust/weglet-security/src/risk.rs` looks at an address and decides whether
it is worth saying something about: punycode, letters that are Latin in
disguise, mixed alphabets, brand names in domains that are not the
brand's, known shorteners, credential pages on throwaway TLDs.

**These are advisory, and they are wrong in both directions.** They miss
real phishing and they flag innocent sites. Nothing else in the browser
depends on them being right, and that is deliberate — a miss is a quality
bug, not a hole.

What keeps them honest is `tests/corpus.rs`, which measures the false
positive and false negative rate against `tests/corpus.txt` and fails when
either goes past its budget. Change a rule and that test says what the
change cost, in a number rather than an opinion.

Two levels:

- **Warning** — dismissible. Something is unusual, the user decides.
- **Block** — not dismissible. The lookalike is unambiguous, or the
  address is structurally unsafe (control characters, a backslash in the
  authority, credentials before the host).

The security notice page shows for exactly one reason: a navigation
`WegletSecurityGuard` stopped. `ProceedPastSecurityNotice` grants a
one-shot allowance for that address and re-navigates; it refuses outright
when the notice was a hard block, on the browser-process side rather than
the page's, since a page is our own code but runs in a renderer and a
compromised renderer could send the message anyway.

## Where blocking happens, and where it does not

`WegletSecurityGuard`, scoped to the `BrowserContext`, is the one place
that decides whether a navigation may proceed. Two callers reach it:

- `WegletNavigationThrottle`, registered from
  `CreateThrottlesForNavigation` on `WegletContentBrowserClient` — content's
  own extension point for this. It runs on every top-level navigation the
  network stack starts, including redirects: a shortened link that
  resolves to a lookalike is judged again once the destination is known,
  at `WillRedirectRequest`.
- `WegletWindow`, for the URLs it hands the engine directly: the omnibox,
  a restored tab's URL, a link or `window.open` through `OpenURLFromTab`.

The guard checks the user's own block list and the built-in one first,
then the heuristics, and stops only on a hard block. The built-in
ad-and-tracker list in `blocklist.rs` is asked through the same path as
the phishing heuristics, so it applies to a redirect exactly as it applies
to the first request — not yet to individual subresources, which is a
different question: `CreateURLLoaderThrottles` is the extension point for
that, and nothing currently uses it for resource-level blocking.

## The lists are data, and a profile can replace them

The blocklist, the brand rules and the sensitive-word list were const
arrays in Rust, which meant updating any of them was a recompile. They are
data files now — `rust/weglet-security/data/` and
`rust/weglet-profile/data/` — compiled in with `include_str!`.

Compiled in, not fetched: Weglet makes no request the user did not ask
for, so there is nothing to update them *from*, and a data file shipped
next to the binary is one more thing to sign and lose.

A profile can override any of them without a build. Drop one of these into
the profile directory and it replaces the built-in table entirely:

| File | Replaces |
|---|---|
| `blocklist.txt` | ad and tracker hosts |
| `brands.toml` | the brands the heuristics know |
| `sensitive_words.txt` | words that suggest a credential page |
| `engines.toml` | the search engines settings offers |

**Replaces, not extends.** Someone who supplies a list has a reason, and
silently keeping entries they removed would defeat it.

A malformed file is reported and ignored, never fatal, and the structured
ones are rejected whole rather than partly applied — half a brand table is
a browser that catches some impostors and waves others through, with
nothing to say which.

Nothing is ever written to these files, so a profile that never had one
never gets one.

## The host is parsed in one place

`weglet_is_url_blocked` takes a whole URL and pulls the host out on the
Rust side, using `weglet-url`. This is not a convenience. A second host
parser on the C++ side would have to know two things that are easy to get
wrong:

- a backslash ends the authority exactly like a slash, so
  `https://example.com\@evil.example` is host `example.com`;
- the host is what follows the **last** `@`, so
  `https://google.com@evil.example/` is `evil.example`.

Getting either wrong on the block-list path means the check runs against a
host the browser is not connected to.

## No `innerHTML`, anywhere

`ui/src/dom.ts` has no way to set markup from a string. Every string that
reaches the DOM goes through `textContent`, so a page title or a bookmark
name containing markup is text. Icons are built with `createElementNS` and
path data rather than parsed from SVG source, so there is no innerHTML
call anywhere for the next one to look normal next to.

`ui/src/trusted_types.d.ts` declares `TrustedHTML` and friends as opaque:
nothing in this codebase can construct one, because nothing needs to.

## What is deliberately not defended against

- **A user who has lost their machine.** There is no encryption at rest
  beyond what the platform provides. `settings.toml` and `session.toml`
  are plain files.
- **A malicious extension.** There is no extension system.
- **Network-level observation.** Weglet is not a VPN and does not claim to
  be. The block list is a local list; a blocked host still resolves.
- **A compromised Chromium.** Weglet is an embedder. Everything below the
  content layer's public interface is Chromium's sandbox and Chromium's
  problem, and keeping it that way is why `weglet/DEPS` allows only
  `content/public`.
